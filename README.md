# RefugeeTweetAnalysis(v1)

I analyzed tweets in "train-false.txt" (dataset of pro-refugee tweets) and "train-true.txt" (dataset of anti-refugee tweets) to create a dictionary of words and their associated scores. I used this dictionary to find the sentiment of tweets in "test-cleaned.txt" by dividing the sum of each word in the tweet by the total number of words.
